HumZuban aims to bridge the gap between sign language users and their non-sign user counterparts to ease communication between them and to promote open dialogue in various facets of life, be it in a personal or professional capacity. This is achieved by utlising Computer Vision models to recognise gestures, and using Deep Learning models to translate these gestures to their corresponding meanings, and conversely spoken words into text via an API-based speech-to-text module. Our system will be hosted on a cloud-based database for uninterrupted communication. With this, we aim to reduce inequality in the workplace, promote diversity in various professional fields, and increase awareness for Pakistani Sign Language Users thus increasing a sense of community among all.
